# Fallback Pipeline Recovery Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-07-11 UTC  
**Operation:** Hardening the GHOST↔DEV fallback pipeline for Fly + Tunnel reliability  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## 🎯 Mission Summary

Successfully implemented a hardened fallback pipeline that eliminates tunnel/Fly flakiness as a source of pipeline failure through isolated watchdogs, retry/rescue automation, and process-level monitoring.

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Separate Watchdog Daemons ✅ COMPLETED

**Created dedicated watchdog daemons for Fly, Tunnel, and Patch Runner:**

- **`scripts/watchdog-fly.sh`** - Monitors Fly health with `fly status` + `curl /health`
- **`scripts/watchdog-tunnel.sh`** - Monitors `cloudflared` PID + localhost endpoint  
- **`scripts/watchdog-runner.sh`** - Monitors patch-runner daemon + queue health

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive health checks with multiple validation points
- Dashboard notifications via Slack webhooks
- Automatic repair trigger on failure detection
- Detailed logging to `logs/watchdogs/` directory
- UUID tracking for operation correlation

### Phase 2: Recovery Scripts and Fallback Retry Logic ✅ COMPLETED

**Added repair scripts with logging + auto-retry:**

- **`scripts/repair-fly.sh`** - Fly app restart, deployment, and scaling with health verification
- **`scripts/repair-tunnel.sh`** - Cloudflare tunnel restart with process cleanup and health checks
- **`scripts/repair-runner.sh`** - Patch runner restart with stuck patch cleanup and health verification

**Added retry patch delivery with escalation:**

- **`scripts/retry-patch-delivery.sh`** - Tracks failed patches and escalates after 3 failures
- Auto-triggers `scripts/send-fallback-to-github.sh` when failure persists
- JSON-based failure tracking with cleanup of old failures
- Comprehensive patch queue health monitoring

### Phase 3: Launchd and Cron Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**Created plist generation and installation:**

- **`scripts/generate-watchdog-plists.sh`** - Generates .plist files for all three daemons
- Uses existing `_global/dev-tools/gen-launchd-watchdog.js` generator
- Automatic installation via `launchctl load`
- Cron entries for extra safety (every 5 mins for watchdogs, 10 mins for retry)

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation ✅ COMPLETED

**Created comprehensive test suite:**

- **`scripts/test-fallback-pipeline.sh`** - Simulates failures and validates recovery
- Tests all three failure scenarios (Fly, Tunnel, Runner)
- Monitors watchdog responses and repair activities
- Generates detailed test reports with metrics

### Fallback Pipeline Flow
```
Patch Failure → Retry (3x) → Escalation → GitHub Fallback

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Reliability Improvements
- **3 separate watchdog daemons** - Eliminates shared failure points
- **Automatic repair triggers** - Self-healing on failure detection
- **Escalation after 3 failures** - Prevents infinite retry loops
- **GitHub fallback trigger** - Ensures patch delivery even when primary pipeline fails

### Monitoring Coverage
- **Fly health:** Status checks, health endpoints, log monitoring
- **Tunnel health:** Process monitoring, localhost endpoints, external connectivity
- **Runner health:** Daemon status, port listening, queue health, log analysis

### Automation Features
- **Launchd integration** - Auto-start on boot with proper .plist files
- **Cron safety net** - Additional health checks every 5-10 minutes
- **Dashboard notifications** - Real-time alerts via Slack webhooks
- **UUID tracking** - Full operation correlation across all components

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Simulated Failure Scenarios
1. **Fly Failure Simulation** ✅ - Watchdog detects and triggers repair
2. **Tunnel Failure Simulation** ✅ - Process kill detected, restart initiated  
3. **Runner Failure Simulation** ✅ - Daemon failure detected, restart triggered

### Recovery Validation
- **Repair scripts execute** ✅ - All repair scripts respond to failures
- **Dashboard notifications** ✅ - Slack alerts sent for all failure types
- **Health verification** ✅ - Services restored and verified healthy
