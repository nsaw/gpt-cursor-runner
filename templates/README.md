# Environment Templates (Hardened)

This directory contains sanitized environment templates for all ThoughtPilot tiers with hardened patterns.

## Hardening Features

- **Anti-terminal-blocking patterns**: All operations use background execution
- **CI safety**: Forced-forward execution regardless of previous state
- **Comprehensive logging**: All operations logged to `/tmp/thoughtpilot-hardening.log`
- **Validation gates**: Multiple validation checkpoints
- **Rollback procedures**: Automatic cleanup on failure

## Templates

- `thoughtpilot-free.env` - Free tier configuration (hardened)
- `thoughtpilot-pro.env` - Pro tier configuration (hardened)
