2025-08-08T01:38:55:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-08-08T01:38:55: 
2025-08-08T01:38:55: USAGE:
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-08-08T01:38:55: 
2025-08-08T01:38:55: DESCRIPTION:
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-08-08T01:38:55: 
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-08-08T01:38:55:   any old connection records.

2025-08-08T01:38:55: If all are unavailable, a random port will be used. Note that when running cloudflared from an virtual
2025-08-08T01:38:55: environment the default address binds to all interfaces, hence, it is important to isolate the host
2025-08-08T01:38:55: and virtualized host network stacks from each other (default: "localhost:0") [$TUNNEL_METRICS]
