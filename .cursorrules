# Shell Enforcement Rules for gpt-cursor-runner
# Enforces zsh or bash usage, prevents PowerShell

## CRITICAL: Shell Usage Enforcement

### Allowed Shells
- `/bin/zsh` (preferred)
- `/bin/bash` (fallback)

### Blocked Shells
- `powershell` (PowerShell Core)
- `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+)
- `cmd` (Windows Command Prompt)
- `cmd.exe` (Windows Command Prompt)

### Terminal Configuration
- Default terminal profile: zsh
- Fallback terminal profile: bash
- All terminal commands must use Unix shell syntax
- No PowerShell-specific commands or syntax allowed

### Script Execution
- All shell scripts must use bash or zsh syntax
- No .ps1 files should be executed
- All commands must be compatible with Unix shells
- Use `{ command & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown` pattern for background processes

##***REMOVED***
- SHELL must be set to /bin/zsh or /bin/bash
- No PowerShell-specific environment variables
- Use Unix-style path separators (/)

### File Associations
- .ps1 files should be treated as plaintext
- .sh files should be executable with bash/zsh
- All script files should use Unix line endings

### Validation
- Check shell type before executing commands
- Verify commands are Unix-compatible
- Block any PowerShell-specific syntax
- Ensure all paths use absolute Unix paths

## Enforcement
- Automatic detection and blocking of PowerShell usage
- Redirect to zsh/bash when PowerShell detected
- Log all shell usage for compliance monitoring
- Prevent execution of PowerShell scripts
