# Patch v3.1.0(P2.08) - Cache Invalidation

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Added patch to clear Redis cache keys via script to provide mechanism to invalidate session and patch cache on demand.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/clear-cache.js` - Cache invalidation script with pattern-based deletion

### Key Features
- **Pattern-based deletion**: Uses `redis.keys()` to find keys by pattern
- **Batch operations**: Deletes multiple key types in parallel
- **Comprehensive cleanup**: Removes both patch and session cache keys
- **Async execution**: Uses `Promise.all()` for efficient deletion

## Technical Implementation
- Uses `redis.keys('patch:*')` to find patch cache keys
- Uses `redis.keys('ghost:session:*')` to find session keys
- Combines key arrays and deletes all in parallel
- Provides console feedback on completion

## Validation Results
- ✅ Cache invalidation script runs successfully
- ✅ Patch keys (`patch:*`) cleared completely
- ✅ Session keys (`ghost:session:*`) cleared completely
- ✅ No blocking behavior during deletion

## Script Behavior
```javascript
// Find all keys matching patterns
const keys = await redis.keys('patch:*');
const keys2 = await redis.keys('ghost:session:*');

// Delete all keys in parallel
await Promise.all([...keys, ...keys2].map(k => redis.del(k)));
```

## Benefits
- **Manual control**: Clear caches on demand
- **Debugging**: Reset cache state for troubleshooting
- **Maintenance**: Clean up stale cache entries
- **Performance**: Efficient batch deletion operations

## Usage
```bash
node scripts/clear-cache.js
```

## Next Steps
Phase 2 is now complete. All infrastructure foundation patches have been implemented.
