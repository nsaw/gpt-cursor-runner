# Current State Audit Summary

## Date: December 2024
## Status: CRITICAL - System Resource Exhaustion Detected

### Executive Summary
The gpt-cursor-runner system is experiencing severe resource constraints with over 300 processes running, causing terminal commands to fail with "fork failed: resource temporarily unavailable" errors. This is preventing proper validation of the GHOST 2.0 refactor implementation across all phases.

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. System Resource Exhaustion
- **Problem**: Over 300 processes running, causing fork failures
- **Impact**: Terminal commands failing, system unresponsive
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate process cleanup and load balancing from Phase 1 implementation
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must be resolved before any other testing

#### 2. GHOST 2.0 Implementation Status
- **Phase 1**: Files exist but Redis connectivity cannot be verified due to resource issues
- **Phase 2**: Files exist but async processing cannot be verified
- **Phase 3**: Files exist but microservice communication cannot be verified  
- **Phase 4**: Files exist, ML pipeline partially working

#### 3. ML Pipeline Status
- ✅ Log classifier creates anomaly.log
- ✅ Anomaly checker runs without errors
- ✅ Predictive analytics script exists
- ✅ Analytics directory now fixed (was empty)
- ❌ Cannot fully test due to resource constraints

#### 4. Core Utilities Status
- ✅ Redis client configured
- ✅ Registry system implemented
- ✅ Async logging functional
- ❌ Cannot verify Redis is actually running
- ❌ Missing directories (services/registry was missing, now created)

#### 5. Microservice Testing Blocked
- Cannot test HTTP endpoints due to resource issues
- Cannot verify all npm packages are properly installed
- Cannot validate inter-service communication

### Immediate Action Plan

1. **Force audit all background and foreground processes**
2. **Implement aggressive process cleanup**
3. **Verify and fix load balancing mechanisms**
4. **Test all Phase 1-4 implementations once resources available**
5. **Validate Redis connectivity and microservice communication**
6. **Complete ML pipeline testing**

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: System may become completely unresponsive if process count continues to grow
- **Medium Risk**: Data corruption if Redis is not properly running
- **Low Risk**: Minor functionality gaps in ML pipeline

### Next Steps
1. Emergency process cleanup and resource monitoring
2. Comprehensive audit of all running processes
3. Validation of all GHOST 2.0 phases
4. Full system testing once resources are available
