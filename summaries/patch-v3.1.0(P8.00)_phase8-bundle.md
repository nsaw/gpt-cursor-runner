- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-21T20:04:00Z

## Mutations Applied
1. **Created**: `scripts/watchdog/self-heal.sh`
   - Self-healing watchdog for ports 4040 and 5051
   - Automatic restart of failed services
2. **Created**: `scripts/hooks/role-aware-router.js`
   - Command routing for slash commands
   - Phase8 and patch command handlers
3. **Created**: `scripts/hooks/patch-validation-loop.js`
   - GPT enforcement validation for patches
   - Summary file requirement check
4. **Created**: `scripts/validate/visual-ai-check.sh`
   - Screenshot diff detection
   - Visual change validation
5. **Created**: `scripts/validate/clock-drift-check.sh`
   - Clock synchronization validation
   - Time drift detection
6. **Created**: `scripts/failsafe/fire-escape.sh`
   - Emergency state dump and recovery
   - Tar.gz backup creation
7. **Created**: `scripts/freezer/phase-freezer.sh`
   - Phase state freezing
   - Backup to _backups directory
8. **Created**: `bin/ghost`

## Validation Results
- ✅ All scripts created and made executable
- ✅ Self-healing watchdog tested (ports not running, expected)
- ✅ Ghost CLI binary verified
- ✅ Validation scripts ready for execution

## Technical Details
- **Self-Healing**: Monitors ports 4040, 5051
- **CLI Commands**: status, recover, freeze
- **Validation**: Visual diffs, clock drift, patch enforcement
- **Recovery**: Automatic state dumps and backups

## Next Steps
- Test all validation scripts with real data
- Verify self-healing with actual service failures
- Test CLI commands with proper arguments
- Monitor system autonomy and recovery capabilities
