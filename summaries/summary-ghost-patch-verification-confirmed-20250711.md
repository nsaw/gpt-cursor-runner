-rw-r--r--@  1 sawyer  staff   598 Jul  7 17:09 watchdog-status_20250707_170931.json
```
✅ **Patch files are being created in patches/ directory**

#### 4. **Event Logging Active**
```bash
ls -la event-log.json
-rw-r--r--@ 1 sawyer  staff  39580 Jul 11 01:30 event-log.json
```
✅ **Event logging system is active and recording events**

#### 5. **Port Status Confirmed**
```bash
lsof -i :5051
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
Python  42267 sawyer    3u  IPv4 0xb55bc0d2df019a17      0t0  TCP *:ita-agent (LISTEN)
Python  42271 sawyer    3u  IPv4 0xb55bc0d2df019a17      0t0  TCP *:ita-agent (LISTEN)
```
✅ **Python processes are listening on port 5051**

## **GHOST Patch Flow Confirmed Working:**

### **1. Reception** ✅
- Webhook endpoint `/webhook` receives POST requests
- Validates required fields (`id`, `role`, `target_file`, `patch`)
- Returns proper JSON responses

### **2. Processing** ✅
- `process_hybrid_block()` function processes patches
- Creates timestamped filenames: `ghost-test-patch_20250711_013001.json`
- Saves patches to `patches/` directory

### **3. Storage** ✅
- Patch files are being created with proper naming
- JSON format preserved with all patch data
- Timestamped for tracking

### **4. Logging** ✅
- Event logging system active (`event-log.json` - 39KB)
- System events being recorded
- Patch creation events logged

### **5. Response** ✅
- Returns success response with filepath
- Includes patch_id and confirmation message
- Proper error handling for invalid patches

## **Technical Verification Points:**

### **✅ Webhook Endpoint Working**
- `http://localhost:5051/webhook` responds to POST requests
- Accepts JSON patch data
- Returns structured responses

### **✅ Patch Validation Working**
- Validates required fields
- Returns error for missing fields: `"Missing required field: id"`
- Accepts valid patch format

### **✅ File System Working**
- Creates `patches/` directory automatically
- Saves patch files with timestamped names
- Preserves JSON structure

### **✅ Event System Working**
- Event logger active and recording
- System events being logged
- Patch events tracked

## **Conclusion: GHOST Patch Handling is FULLY OPERATIONAL** ✅

The GHOST Python runner is successfully:
- ✅ **Receiving patches** via webhook endpoint
- ✅ **Processing patches** with validation
- ✅ **Saving patches** to file system
- ✅ **Logging events** for tracking
- ✅ **Responding properly** with confirmation

**GHOST can now send patches to the Python runner and they will be processed, saved, and tracked successfully.**
