# Patch v3.1.0(P2.04) - Async Logging

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Migrated all audit and runtime logs to async write streams to improve performance and non-blocking audit output.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `utils/log.js` - Async logging utility with `writeLog()` function
- `scripts/processor.js` - Updated to use async logging
- `scripts/runner.js` - Mock runner for testing
- `logs/audit.log` - Audit log file with async writes

### Key Features
- **Async file operations**: Uses `fs.promises.appendFile()` for non-blocking writes
- **Structured logging**: Timestamped log entries with patch information
- **Error logging**: Separate error handling with detailed error messages
- **Reusable utility**: `writeLog()` function for consistent logging across modules

## Technical Implementation
- Replaced synchronous `fs.appendFileSync()` with async `fs.promises.appendFile()`
- Created reusable `writeLog(file, line)` helper function
- Integrated logging into patch processor with success/error tracking
- Added timestamp formatting for audit trail

## Validation Results
- ✅ Async logging utility created and functional
- ✅ Audit log file generated with proper timestamps
- ✅ Success and error logging working correctly
- ✅ No blocking behavior observed during logging

## Log Format
```
[2025-07-21T02:25:45.013Z] Ran patch: test-patch.js
[2025-07-21T02:25:36.806Z] Error in patch: test-patch.js - Cannot find module './runner'
```

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Non-blocking I/O prevents event loop blocking
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and logging
- **Audit trail**: Timestamped entries for debugging
- **Consistency**: Standardized logging format across modules

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with Redis integration and caching features.
