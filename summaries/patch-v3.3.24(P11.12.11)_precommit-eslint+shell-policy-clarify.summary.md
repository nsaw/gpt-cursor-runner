# Patch Summary: precommit-eslint+shell-policy-clarify

**Patch ID**: `patch-v3.3.24(P11.12.11)_precommit-eslint+shell-policy-clarify`  
**Version**: `patch-v3.3.24(P11.12.11)_precommit-eslint+shell-policy-clarify`  
**Project**: DEV:gpt-cursor-runner  
**Target**: DEV  
**Status**: ✅ PASS

## Patch Description

Created pre-commit ESLint tools and shell policy clarification to establish pre-commit as the ESLint gate and add zsh guard validation.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Tools Created:

1. **`/scripts/tools/run-precommit.sh`** - Non-blocking pre-commit runner
   - Validates pre-commit is installed
   - Checks for .pre-commit-config.yaml
   - Runs pre-commit hooks in manual stage mode
   - Used by nb.js for CI/validation

2. **`/scripts/tools/check-zsh-guard.sh`** - Zsh interactive guard validator
   - Checks for interactive-only guards in ~/.zshrc
   - Advisory mode by default, enforce mode with CYOPS_ZSH_GUARD_MODE=enforce
   - Generates recommendations for missing guards
   - Creates shell guard documentation

### Policy Files Created:

3. **`/.cursor/rules/008_precommit-eslint.mdc`** - Project-specific ESLint rule
   - Establishes pre-commit as the ESLint gate
   - Defines CI validation requirements
   - Sets hook error/warning thresholds

4. **`/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor/rules/008_precommit-eslint.mdc`** - Global ESLint rule
   - Global pre-commit ESLint policy
   - Applies across all projects

## Validation Results

### Post-Mutation Build:

- ✅ All scripts made executable (0755/0644)
- ✅ Documentation nb examples fixed
- ✅ Non-blocking enforcement validation completed
- ✅ Documentation nb enforcement completed

### Validation Checks:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation (if present)
- ✅ Unit tests (if defined)
- ✅ Node version check (20.17.0)
- ✅ Pre-commit validation
- ✅ Zsh guard validation

### Expected Files Created:

- ✅ `/validations/status/` - Status tracking directory
- ✅ `/validations/logs/` - Validation logs directory
- ✅ `/summaries/` - Summary files directory

## Pre-commit Integration

### ESLint Gate Policy:

- **ESLint must be run via pre-commit hooks**
- **CI/validate uses `scripts/tools/run-precommit.sh`**
- **Non-blocking execution via nb.js**
- **Fails build on hook errors or warning thresholds**

### Pre-commit Requirements:

- **pre-commit must be installed** (`pipx install pre-commit` or `pip install pre-commit`)
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml` must exist**
- **Manual stage hooks run for validation**

## Shell Policy Clarification

### Zsh Guard Validation:

- **Checks for interactive-only guards in ~/.zshrc**
- **Advisory mode by default** (warns but doesn't fail)
- **Enforce mode available** with `CYOPS_ZSH_GUARD_MODE=enforce`
- **Generates recommendations** for missing guards

### Recommended Zsh Guard:

```zsh
case $- in *i*) ;; *) return ;; esac
# heavy plugins below (interactive sessions only)
```

## Validation Status

- ✅ All tools created successfully
- ✅ All scripts made executable
- ✅ Policy files created in both project and global locations
- ✅ Non-blocking validation completed
- ✅ All expected directories and files created
- ✅ Pre-commit integration established
- ✅ Shell policy clarification implemented

## Generated Files

- `/validations/status/` - Status tracking for nb.js operations
- `/validations/logs/` - Validation logs for all checks
- `/summaries/cyops-shell-guard.md` - Shell guard recommendations (if needed)

## Notes

- Pre-commit is now the official ESLint gate for the project
- Zsh guard validation provides shell performance recommendations
- All validation runs non-blocking via nb.js
- Policy files establish consistent ESLint practices across projects
- Rollback capability available through git if needed
