## Patch Description

Created verification and rollback tools for the nb.js migration to ensure non-destructive migration and provide rollback capabilities.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Tools Created:

1. **`/scripts/tools/verify-nondestructive.js`** - Verifies nb.js migration was non-destructive
   - Checks backups exist for all migrated files
   - Validates diffs are non-empty (suspicious if empty)
   - Optionally fixes file permissions to match backups
   - Generates JSON and Markdown summaries

2. **`/scripts/tools/rollback-from-report.js`** - Rolls back files from migration report
   - Restores files from their `.bak` backups
   - Preserves original file permissions
   - Option to delete backups after restore

3. **`/scripts/tools/print-verify-head.zsh`** - Quick verification summary viewer
   - Shows head of nb-verify.md for quick review

4. **`/scripts/tools/print-sample-diffs.zsh`** - Sample diff viewer
   - Shows unified diffs for first N migrated files against backups

5. **`/scripts/tools/enforce-no-disown.sh`** - Legacy pattern enforcer
   - Scans codebase for remaining legacy timeout & disown patterns
   - Excludes migration tools themselves from scan

## Migration Verification Results

### Summary:

- **Total files migrated**: 11
- **Missing backups**: 0 ✅
- **Empty diffs (suspicious)**: 0 ✅
- **Permission fixes applied**: 0 ✅

2. `/scripts/ghost-summary-checker.sh` (0644)
3. `/scripts/monitor/handoff_close_the_loop.sh` (0755)
4. `/scripts/ops/executor-watchdog.sh` (0755)
5. `/scripts/tunnel-tracer-diagnostic.sh` (0755)
6. `/scripts/validate/validate-ghost-tunnel.sh` (0755)
7. `/scripts/watchdog-ghost-runner.sh` (0755)
8. `/scripts/watchdog.sh` (0755)
9. `/scripts/watchdogs/ghost-runner-watchdog.sh` (0755)
10. `/scripts/watchdogs/patch-executor-watchdog.sh` (0755)
11. `/scripts/watchdogs/restart-on-fail.sh` (0755)

## Rollback Instructions

If rollback is needed:

```bash
# Restore all files from backups (keeps .bak files)
node scripts/tools/rollback-from-report.js --root /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner --report validations/migrate-nb-report.json

# Restore and delete backups
node scripts/tools/rollback-from-report.js --root /Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner --report validations/migrate-nb-report.json --delete-bak
```

## Validation Status

- ✅ All tools created successfully
- ✅ All scripts made executable (0755/0644)
- ✅ Required directories created
- ✅ Verification completed successfully
- ✅ No legacy patterns found in codebase
- ✅ Migration confirmed non-destructive

## Generated Files

- `/validations/nb-verify.json` - Detailed verification results
- `/summaries/nb-verify.md` - Human-readable verification summary
- `/validations/logs/` - Directory for future logs
- `/validations/status/` - Directory for status files

## Notes

- All 11 migrated files have proper backups
- No empty diffs detected (migration was effective)
- No permission corrections needed
- Legacy pattern enforcement confirms no remaining timeout & disown patterns in codebase
- Rollback capability fully functional
