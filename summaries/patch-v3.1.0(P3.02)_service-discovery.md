# Patch v3.1.0(P3.02) - Service Discovery

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P3 - Microservices Architecture  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Added local service registry with hostname and port info to allow services to register and discover each other by name.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `utils/registry.js` - Service registry utility with register/resolve functions
- `services/runner/index.js` - Updated to register with service registry
- `services/registry/registry.json` - Service registry file (created on startup)

### Key Features
- **Service registration**: Services register themselves with name and port
- **Service resolution**: Lookup service addresses by name
- **JSON registry**: Persistent registry file for service discovery
- **Auto-registration**: Services automatically register on startup

## Technical Implementation
- Registry utility with `register(name, port)` and `resolve(name)` functions
- JSON-based registry file at `services/registry/registry.json`
- Runner service registers itself as 'runner' on port 5050
- Registry file created/updated on service startup

## Registry Format
```json
{
  "runner": {
    "port": 5050
  }
}
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ Registry utility created with register/resolve functions
- ✅ Runner service updated to register on startup
- ✅ Service discovery mechanism implemented
- ✅ Registry file structure defined

## Benefits
- **Service discovery**: Services can find each other by name
- **Dynamic registration**: Services register themselves automatically
- **Centralized registry**: Single source of truth for service locations
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services to the registry

## Next Steps
Phase 3 continues with additional microservice components.
