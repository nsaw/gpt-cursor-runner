# Patch v3.1.0(P1.07) - Rate Limiting

## Execution Summary
**Date**: 2025-07-21 19:56:04  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Phase**: P1 - CRITICAL FOUNDATION

## Mutation Log
- ✅ Updated `scripts/processor.js` with in-memory rate limiting
- ✅ Implemented 10-second cooldown mechanism
- ✅ Added rate limit checking before patch execution
- ✅ Created test script to validate rate limiting
- ✅ Rate limiting functionality validated

## Runtime Effects Traced
- **Before**: No rate limiting on patch execution
- **After**: In-memory rate limiting with:
  - 10-second cooldown period
  - Rate limit checking before execution
  - Automatic cooldown tracking
  - Prevention of rapid successive executions

## Service Validation
- ✅ Rate limiting: Working correctly with 10-second cooldown
- ✅ Cooldown mechanism: Prevents rapid successive calls
- ✅ Rate limit tracking: In-memory Map implementation
- ✅ Test validation: Confirmed rate limiting behavior
- ✅ Clean state: No lingering rate limit issues

## Commit Gates Passed
- ✅ Rate limiting logic implemented correctly
- ✅ Cooldown mechanism tested and validated
- ✅ Rate limit test confirmed functionality
- ✅ In-memory implementation working
- ✅ Test script created and executed successfully

## Validation Results
- **First Call**: Executed successfully
- **Second Call**: Rate limited (cooldown active)
- **Third Call**: Executed after 11-second wait
- **Cooldown Period**: 10 seconds working correctly
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory implementation functional

## Next Steps
Proceeding to P1.08 - Request Validation patch
