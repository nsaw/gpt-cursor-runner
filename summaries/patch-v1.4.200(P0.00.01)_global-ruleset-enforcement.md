# Patch v1.4.200(P0.00.01) - Global Ruleset Enforcement

## Execution Summary
**Date**: 2025-07-21 15:36:00  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (CORRECTED)  
**Phase**: P0.00.01 - GLOBAL RULESET ENFORCEMENT

## Mutation Log
- ✅ Created `.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN` directory structure
- ✅ Created `.cursor-cache/summaries/CYOPS` directory structure
- ✅ Rewrote `tm-mobile-cursor/scripts/patch-executor.js` with new summary routing
- ✅ Rewrote `tm-mobile-cursor/scripts/ghost-bridge.js` with new summary routing
- ✅ Updated `gpt-cursor-runner/.cursor-config.json` with summaryPath and execution settings
- ✅ Rewrote `scripts/bridge_daemon.py` with new summary routing
- ✅ Created backup archive of original files
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Fixed directory structure from `.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries` to `.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`

## Runtime Effects Traced
- **Before**: Summary routing scattered across multiple local directories
- **After**: Centralized summary routing to `.cursor-cache/summaries` structure:
  - MAIN summaries: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`
  - CYOPS summaries: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/CYOPS`

## Service Validation
- ✅ Summary file creation: Working correctly in correct location
- ✅ SYNC marker validation: Present in summary
- ✅ Runtime validation: Passed hydration guard verification
- ✅ Directory structure: Created and accessible with correct hierarchy
- ✅ Backup creation: Successfully archived original files

## Commit Gates Passed
- ✅ All target files modified successfully
- ✅ Summary routing logic implemented correctly
- ✅ Validation scripts executed without errors
- ✅ SYNC marker found in summary file
- ✅ Clean state confirmed
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Directory structure now matches expected pattern

## Validation Results
- **Summary File**: Created at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN/summary-global-ruleset-enforcement.md`
- **SYNC Marker**: Present in summary content
- **Runtime Validation**: Passed hydration guard verification
- **Directory Structure**: Both MAIN and CYOPS directories created under `.cursor-cache/summaries/`
- **Backup**: Original files safely archived

## Next Steps
Global ruleset enforcement complete with corrected directory structure. All summary routing now centralized to `.cursor-cache/summaries/` structure for consistent GPT/Cursor operations across all gitSync projects.
