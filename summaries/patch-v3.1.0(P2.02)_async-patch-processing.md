# Patch v3.1.0(P2.02) - Async Patch Processing

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Ensured each patch mutation is wrapped in awaitable processor to allow multiple queued patches to resolve sequentially without blocking.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/patch-executor.js` - Async patch executor with sequential processing
- `tasks/queue/` - Directory for patch queue management

### Key Features
- **Sequential processing**: Patches are processed one at a time in order
- **Async file operations**: Uses `fs.promises.readdir()` for non-blocking directory reading
- **Error isolation**: Individual patch failures don't stop the queue
- **Order preservation**: Queue drain respects patch order

## Technical Implementation
- Wrapped patch execution in async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- Used `for...of` loop to maintain sequential order
- Added try/catch blocks for individual patch error handling
- Implemented proper error logging with patch identification

## Validation Results
- ✅ Patch queue drained without overlap
- ✅ Sequential processing maintained
- ✅ Error handling works per patch
- ✅ No race conditions observed

## Benefits
- **Ordered execution**: Patches process in queue order
- **Fault tolerance**: Single patch failure doesn't break queue
- **Non-blocking**: Async operations prevent event loop blocking
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple patches efficiently

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with async health checks and logging improvements.
