# GHOST Python Runner Recovery Mission Status

**Date:** 2025-07-11  
**Mission:** Finalize local GHOST boot after fallback recovery and resolve Node/Python port conflict  
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

## Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Node.js Server Halt

### Actions Executed
- ✅ Identified Node.js process 4656 using port 5051
- ✅ Successfully terminated `node server/index.js` process
- ✅ Verified port 5051 is now clear

### Results
- Port 5051 freed for Python GHOST runner
- No conflicts detected

## Phase 2: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Python GHOST Boot

### Actions Attempted
- ✅ Started Python runner with `PORT=5051 nohup python3 -m gpt_cursor_runner.main`
- 🔄 Health check endpoints being tested
- 🔄 Recovery status verification in progress

### Current Status
- Python runner process started (PID: 36737)
- Background health checks running
- Terminal commands running in background to prevent blocking

## Phase 3: ⏳ PENDING - Slack and Dashboard Verification

### Planned Actions
- Test local slash commands endpoint
- Verify dashboard functionality
- Validate summary writing to `/summaries`

## Technical Notes

### Port Conflict Resolution
- Original issue: Node.js server blocking port 5051
- Solution: Terminated Node.js, freed port for Python
- Fallback: Using port 5052 if 5051 still has issues

### Background Processing
- All terminal commands running in background mode
- No blocking operations to maintain responsiveness
- Health checks and status verifications in progress

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Python runner health** - Check if runner is responding on port 5051/5052
2. **Test Slack endpoints** - Validate slash command routing
3. **Confirm dashboard** - Ensure local dashboard is accessible
4. **Validate summaries** - Confirm summary writing to `/summaries` directory
