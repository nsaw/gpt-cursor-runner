## Infrastructure Foundation Achievements

### Redis Infrastructure
- **Server**: Redis server operational with optimized configuration
- **Client**: Comprehensive RedisManager class with connection management
- **Operations**: Full CRUD operations with TTL support
- **Integration**: Early boot verification and health checks

### Async Operations
- **File System**: All fs operations converted to async/await
- **Processing**: Non-blocking patch execution and queue processing
- **Health Checks**: Parallel async probes for system monitoring
- **Logging**: Async write streams for audit and runtime logs

### Caching System
- **Patch Caching**: Redis-based deduplication with 1-hour TTL
- **Session Caching**: Daemon metadata with 10-minute TTL
- **Cache Management**: Manual invalidation capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when Redis unavailable

### System Monitoring
- **Health Aggregation**: Parallel async health probes
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive async logging system
- **Session Tracking**: Daemon instance metadata
- **Cache Control**: Manual cache invalidation

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Enhancements
- **Non-blocking Operations**: All file system and Redis operations async
- **Parallel Processing**: Health checks and cache operations run concurrently
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory pressure with async patterns
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent operations

### Reliability Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all async operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works without Redis when unavailable
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup via TTL and error recovery
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health monitoring and audit logging

### Infrastructure Benefits
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based caching for patches and sessions
- **Async Foundation**: Non-blocking operations throughout the system
- **Monitoring Capabilities**: Health aggregation and audit logging
- **Operational Control**: Manual cache invalidation and debugging support
