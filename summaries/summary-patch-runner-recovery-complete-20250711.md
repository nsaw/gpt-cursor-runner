# Patch Runner Recovery Complete - 2025-07-11

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully repaired the patch quarantine system, rerouted daemon off tunnel, and re-enabled patch failure visibility.

## ✅ Phase 1: Patch Runner Quarantine Logic + Logging

### 🔧 Patch Runner Updates (`gpt_cursor_runner/patch_runner.py`)
- **Removed hard Slack webhook dependency** - Patch success no longer requires Slack webhook
- **Added comprehensive failure logging** - All stderr from failed patches saved to `logs/patch-failures/{patchName}.log`
- **Implemented quarantine system** - Failed patches moved to `patches/failed/` instead of `.archive/`
- **Enhanced retry logic** - Added `patch_file_path` parameter to track failed patches
- **Added failure metadata** - Failed patches include timestamp, error message, and original file path

### 📁 Directory Structure Created
```
logs/patch-failures/          # Detailed failure logs
patches/failed/              # Quarantined failed patches
```

### 🔍 Failure Log Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-11T02:57:04.063938",
  "patch_id": "feature-bundle_ui-dashboard_slash-preview_release",
  "target_file": "gpt_cursor_runner/hybrid_bundle_init.md",
  "description": "Implements a UI status dashboard...",
  "success": false,
  "message": "Patch failed after 3 attempts. Marking as quarantined.",
  "stderr_output": "Attempt 1: Target file not found...",
  "patch_data": {...},
  "result": {...}
}
```

### 🔄 Apply All Patches Updates (`apply_all_patches.py`)
- **Smart patch filtering** - Excludes patches that have failed versions in `patches/failed/`
- **Enhanced retry logic** - Passes `patch_file_path` to quarantine system
- **Failure visibility** - Failed patches are clearly marked and logged

## ✅ Phase 2: Reroute Daemon + Patch-Runner from Tunnel to Localhost

### 🆕 New Local Daemon (`scripts/start-local-daemon.sh`)
- **Target**: `http://localhost:5051` instead of tunnel
- **Health checks**: Curl-based health monitoring with fallback to netcat
- **Heartbeat logging**: All health checks logged to `logs/daemon-heartbeat.log`
- **Auto-restart**: Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Status reporting**: Real-time health status and recent heartbeat entries

### 🔧 Watchdog Updates (`watchdog.sh`)
- **Enhanced health checks**: Now checks both process and localhost:5051 response
- **Localhost focus**: Removed tunnel dependency, monitors `http://localhost:5051/health`
- **Better error reporting**: Distinguishes between process down and unresponsive runner

### 📋 Launchd Integration (`scripts/setup-local-daemon.sh`)
- **New plist**: `com.thoughtmarks.local-daemon.plist` for localhost monitoring
- **Auto-start**: Runs at boot and keeps alive
- **Proper logging**: Stdout/stderr redirected to dedicated log files

## 🚨 Failsafe Enforcement Achieved

### ✅ Quarantined patches move to `patches/failed/` not `.archive/`
- Failed patches are now visible and accessible
- Original filenames preserved with `_FAILED_` suffix
- Failure metadata included in quarantined patches

### ✅ Daemon always logs failures to `logs/patch-failures/` with full stderr
- Comprehensive failure logging with timestamps
- Full stderr capture from all retry attempts
- JSON format for easy parsing and analysis

### ✅ Disable Slack webhook as a hard requirement for patch success
- Patch runner no longer fails due to Slack webhook issues
- Slack notifications are optional and don't affect patch success
- Graceful handling of Slack notification failures

### ✅ Patch-runner auto-recovery kicks in after failed runs
- Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Automatic quarantine after max retries
- Clear failure messages and logging

### ✅ Daemon and watchdog monitor `http://localhost:5051` — not tunnel
- Local daemon monitors localhost:5051 continuously
- Watchdog checks both process and health endpoint
- No dependency on external tunnel or Cloudflare

📝 Patch failure logged to: logs/patch-failures/feature-bundle_ui-dashboard_slash-preview_release_20250711_025704.log
🚨 Failed patch quarantined to: patches/failed/feature-bundle_ui-dashboard_slash-preview_release_FAILED_20250711_025704.json
```

### Local Daemon Test
```bash
$ ./scripts/start-local-daemon.sh test
[2025-07-11T09:58:12.3NZ] [INFO] 🧪 Testing connection to http://localhost:5051
[2025-07-11T09:58:12.3NZ] [INFO] ✅ Runner healthy (localhost:5051)
[2025-07-11T09:58:12.3NZ] [SUCCESS] ✅ Connection test passed
```

### Daemon Status
```bash
$ ./scripts/start-local-daemon.sh status
[2025-07-11T09:58:16.3NZ] [INFO] ✅ Local daemon running (PID: 11958)
[2025-07-11T09:58:16.3NZ] [INFO] ✅ Runner healthy (localhost:5051)
[2025-07-11T09:58:16.3NZ] [INFO] 📋 Recent heartbeat entries:
  [2025-07-11T09:58:14.3NZ] [STARTED] Local daemon started monitoring localhost:5051 [rerouted to localhost]
  [2025-07-11T09:58:16.3NZ] [HEALTHY] Runner responding on localhost:5051 [rerouted to localhost]
```

## 🎉 Final Status

### ✅ Patch Quarantine System
- **Working**: Failed patches are quarantined to `patches/failed/`
- **Visible**: All failures logged with full details
- **Recoverable**: Failed patches can be manually reviewed and retried

### ✅ Daemon Reroute
- **Local**: Daemon monitors `http://localhost:5051` instead of tunnel
- **Reliable**: No dependency on external services
- **Monitored**: Continuous health checks with heartbeat logging

### ✅ Patch Failure Visibility
- **Never Silent**: All failures are logged and quarantined
- **Detailed**: Full stderr capture and failure metadata
- **Accessible**: Failed patches moved to visible directory

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Deploy local daemon**: Run `./scripts/setup-local-daemon.sh` to install launchd service
2. **Monitor heartbeat logs**: Check `logs/daemon-heartbeat.log` for health status
3. **Review failed patches**: Examine `patches/failed/` for manual intervention
4. **Test patch recovery**: Manually retry failed patches after fixing issues
