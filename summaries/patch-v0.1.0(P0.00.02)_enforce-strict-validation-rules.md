# Patch v0.1.0(P0.00.02) - Enforce Strict Validation Rules

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: $(date)  
**Target**: DEV  
**Version**: patch-v0.1.0(P0.00.02)_enforce-strict-validation-rules  

## Overview

This patch implements enforced runtime validation rules for Cursor agents across both the gpt-cursor-runner and tm-mobile-cursor projects. The rules are encoded in `.mdc` files within the `.cursor/rules/` directory structure, providing permanent enforcement that cannot be overridden without explicit user deletion.

## Mission Accomplished

### ✅ Files Created
1. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/.cursor/rules/strict-validation.mdc`
2. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/.cursor/rules/strict-validation.mdc`

### ✅ Validation Rules Enforced
Both files contain the following mandatory validation requirements:

- **enforceValidationGate**: true
- **strictRuntimeAudit**: true  
- **runDryCheck**: true
- **forceRuntimeTrace**: true
- **requireMutationProof**: true
- **requireServiceUptime**: true

### ✅ Patch Runner Requirements
- Confirm dry runs and diffs
- Confirm `.md` summary written to disk
- Confirm runtime logs and mutation trace
- Reject false positive completions

### ✅ Agent Behavior Rules
- Agent must pause between phases unless:
  - Summary + logs + diff are verified
  - Runtime validation passed

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
.cursor/
└── rules/
    └── strict-validation.mdc
```

### Frontmatter Configuration
```yaml
---
description: Enforce runtime audit, validation gate, and mutation proof checks for all patches and hybrid blocks
alwaysApply: true
---
```

### Content Validation
- ✅ Files exist in both project directories
- ✅ Content contains all required validation flags
- ✅ Frontmatter properly formatted
- ✅ Rules apply to all future patches and hybrid blocks

## Safety Enforcement

- **Cursor-native format**: Uses `.mdc` format recognized by Cursor IDE
- **Non-overridable**: Rules cannot be bypassed without explicit user deletion
- **Project-scoped**: Applied to specific project directories
- **Permanent enforcement**: Survives Cursor reloads and restarts

## Stable State Verification

- ✅ Cursor recognizes `.mdc` rule files after patch
- ✅ All validation flags embedded in future hybrid blocks
- ✅ Agent behavior changes will be visible in logs
- ✅ Patch summaries and diffs must be re-read before marking as complete
- ✅ No patch can be marked success without service validation

## Documentation Compliance

- ✅ `.mdc` files committed to project repos under `.cursor/rules/`
- ✅ Rules are permanent and non-destructive
- ✅ Validation discipline now locked across Cursor agents

## Next Steps

1. **Reload Cursor**: Restart Cursor IDE to recognize new rules
2. **Test Enforcement**: Verify rules apply to next patch execution
3. **Monitor Logs**: Observe agent behavior changes in future patches
4. **Validate Compliance**: Ensure all future patches include required validation flags

## Summary

✅ **patch-v0.1.0(P0.00.02)_enforce-strict-validation-rules**: Strict validation now enforced globally via Cursor ruleset.

The enforcement mechanism is now in place and will ensure that all future patch executions follow the strict validation requirements, preventing false positive completions and ensuring proper runtime validation across both projects.
