# Patch v3.1.0(P1.05) - Sequential Processing

## Execution Summary
**Date**: 2025-07-21 19:55:00  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Phase**: P1 - CRITICAL FOUNDATION

## Mutation Log
- ✅ Created `scripts/processor.js` with locking mechanism
- ✅ Implemented filesystem-based patch locking
- ✅ Added lock file creation and cleanup
- ✅ Integrated try/catch/finally error handling
- ✅ Executed processor successfully

## Runtime Effects Traced
- **Before**: No patch execution locking mechanism
- **After**: Sequential processing with:
  - Lock file creation (`.patch-lock`)
  - Lock checking before execution
  - Automatic lock cleanup in finally block
  - Error handling with guaranteed lock release

## Service Validation
- ✅ Locking mechanism: Working correctly
- ✅ Lock file management: Created and removed properly
- ✅ Error handling: Lock released even on errors
- ✅ Sequential execution: Ready to prevent overlaps
- ✅ Clean state: No lingering lock files

## Commit Gates Passed
- ✅ Script created and executed without errors
- ✅ Locking logic implemented correctly
- ✅ Lock file cleanup validated
- ✅ Error handling with guaranteed cleanup
- ✅ Clean state confirmed (no lock file)

## Validation Results
- **Lock Mechanism**: Filesystem-based locking implemented
- **Clean State**: No `.patch-lock` file found
- **Error Handling**: Lock released in finally block
- **Sequential Execution**: Ready to prevent concurrent patches

## Next Steps
Proceeding to P1.06 - Error Recovery patch
