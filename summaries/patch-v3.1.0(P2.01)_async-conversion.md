# Patch v3.1.0(P2.01) - Async Conversion

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Converted all blocking logic in patch runner to async/await to prevent blocking behavior and missed async patch returns.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/processor.js` - Async patch processor with proper error handling

### Key Features
- **Async file operations**: Uses `fs.promises` for non-blocking I/O
- **Lock management**: Creates and removes `.patch-lock` file for coordination
- **Error handling**: Proper try/catch/finally blocks
- **Resource cleanup**: Ensures lock file is removed even on errors

## Technical Implementation
- Replaced synchronous `fs` operations with `fs.promises`
- Wrapped patch execution in async function blocks
- Added proper error handling with console logging
- Implemented lock file pattern for coordination

## Validation Results
- ✅ Async processor runs without blocking
- ✅ Lock file is properly created and cleaned up
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ No blocking behavior observed

## Benefits
- **Non-blocking operations**: File I/O no longer blocks the event loop
- **Better error recovery**: Proper cleanup on failures
- **Improved performance**: Async operations allow better concurrency
- **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with async patch processing and health checks.
