# Runner Recovery Status Report
**Date**: 7/10/2025, 7:40 AM  
**Agent**: Dev-Agent  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Terminal Safety Protocol Implemented

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Terminal Safety Protocol**: Implemented timeout enforcement and fallback measures
   - Created `.cursor-config.json` with 30s timeouts and auto-dismissal
   - Built `scripts/safe-run.sh` with macOS-compatible timeout handling
   - Documented safety protocol in `TERMINAL_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md`

2. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Updated runner controller to use port 5053
   - Modified `server/utils/runnerController.js` to set `PYTHON_PORT=5053`
   - Killed conflicting processes on ports 5051 and 5052

### üîÑ In Progress
1. **Python Runner Startup**: Runner processes are starting but need verification
   - Python runner successfully starts on port 5053 (confirmed in terminal output)
   - Health check endpoint needs testing
   - Runner controller integration needs validation

### ‚ùå Issues Identified
1. **Terminal Blocking**: Previous sessions were getting stuck in feedback loops
   - **RESOLVED**: Implemented safety protocol with timeouts and auto-dismissal
   - All future commands will use `./scripts/safe-run.sh` with 30s timeout

2. **Runner Status**: Still showing "Not Running" in Slack status
   - Need to verify Python runner is properly integrated with Node.js controller
   - Health check endpoint may not be responding correctly

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test Runner Health**: Use safe execution to test health endpoint
2. **Verify Integration**: Ensure Python runner is properly managed by Node.js controller
3. **Slack Status Update**: Confirm runner status reflects actual running state

### For GPT
- **Patches Expected**: You mentioned 3-4 patches should have been received
- **GHOST Status**: Need to verify if GHOST relay is working properly
- **Runner Fix**: Continue monitoring and fixing until runner shows as "Running"

## Safety Protocol Active
- All terminal commands now use 30-second timeout
- Auto-dismissal prevents blocking sessions
- Process cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Feedback loop protection prevents infinite retries

## Technical Details
- **Python Runner**: Port 5053, Flask app with health endpoint
- **Node.js Controller**: Manages Python process lifecycle
- **Slack Integration**: Commands routed through Fly.io backend
- **Safety Measures**: Timeout enforcement, auto-dismissal, process cleanup

**Status**: Ready to continue fixing runner issues with safety protocol in place.
