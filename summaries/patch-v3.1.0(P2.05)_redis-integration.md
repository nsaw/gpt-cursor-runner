# Patch v3.1.0(P2.05) - Redis Integration

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Added Redis utility and health check ping to verify connectivity, enabling Redis for caching, locking, and messaging.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `utils/redis.js` - Simplified Redis client utility
- `index.js` - Main entry point with Redis health check

### Key Features
- **Simple Redis client**: Direct ioredis client export
- **Health check on boot**: Verifies Redis connectivity at startup
- **Early failure**: Exits process if Redis is unreachable
- **Connection validation**: Uses ping command for health verification

## Technical Implementation
- Simplified Redis utility to direct client export
- Added async health check in main entry point
- Implemented process exit on connection failure
- Used standard Redis ping for connectivity test

## Validation Results
- ✅ Redis client connects successfully
- ✅ Health check ping passes
- ✅ Process exits gracefully on connection failure
- ✅ Redis CLI responds with PONG

## Benefits
- **Reliability**: Early detection of Redis connectivity issues
- **Simplicity**: Direct Redis client for easy usage
- **Fault tolerance**: Graceful failure handling
- **Integration ready**: Redis available for caching and messaging

## Usage
```javascript
const redis = require('./utils/redis');
await redis.ping(); // Health check
await redis.set('key', 'value'); // Basic operations
```

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with patch caching and session management.
