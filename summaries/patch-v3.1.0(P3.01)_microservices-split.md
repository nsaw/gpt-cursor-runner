# Patch v3.1.0(P3.01) - Microservices Split

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P3 - Microservices Architecture  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Split patch runner into isolated microservice shell to move runner into self-contained service container.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `services/runner/index.js` - Express-based microservice for patch execution

### Key Features
- **HTTP interface**: Express server with POST endpoint for patch execution
- **JSON API**: Accepts JSON payload with file path
- **Async processing**: Integrates with existing async processor
- **Status response**: Returns JSON status on completion

## Technical Implementation
- Created Express server on port 5050
- POST `/run-patch` endpoint accepts JSON with `file` field
- Integrates with existing `scripts/processor.js` logic
- Returns `{ status: 'ok' }` on successful execution

## API Endpoint
```javascript
POST /run-patch
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "file": "path/to/patch.json"
}

Response: { "status": "ok" }
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ Microservice created and configured
- ✅ Express server running on port 5050
- ✅ HTTP endpoint available for patch execution
- ✅ Integration with existing processor logic

## Benefits
- **Isolation**: Runner logic separated into dedicated service
- **HTTP interface**: Can be called from any HTTP client
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed independently
- **API-first**: RESTful interface for patch execution

## Next Steps
Phase 3 continues with additional microservice components.
