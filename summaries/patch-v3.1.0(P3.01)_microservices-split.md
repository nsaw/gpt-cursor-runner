# Patch v3.1.0(P3.01) - Microservices Split

**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Phase**: P3 - Microservices Architecture  
**Date**: 2025-07-21T13:25:00Z  

## Summary
Successfully split patch runner into isolated microservice shell with HTTP interface for receiving trigger JSON.

## Mutations Applied

### 1. Created `services/runner/index.js`
- **Purpose**: Isolated patch runner microservice
- **Features**:
  - Express server on port 5050
  - POST /run-patch endpoint
  - JSON request body parsing
  - Integration with existing processor
  - HTTP response with status

## Post-Mutation Build Results

### ✅ Microservice Test
```bash
timeout 30s node services/runner/index.js & sleep 2 && curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"file":"tasks/test.json"}' http://localhost:5050/run-patch
```
- **Result**: Microservice started and patch executed successfully
- **Output**: `{"status":"ok"}`
- **Validation**: Confirmed HTTP endpoint working correctly

## Validation Results

### ✅ Port Verification
```bash
lsof -i :5050
```
- **Result**: Node process listening on port 5050
- **Validation**: Confirmed microservice running

## Runtime Validation

### ✅ Service Uptime Confirmed
- Microservice started successfully on port 5050
- HTTP endpoint responding correctly
- Patch execution working through HTTP interface
- Integration with existing processor maintained

### ✅ Mutation Proof Verified
- `services/runner/index.js` created with Express server
- HTTP interface implemented for patch triggering
- Integration with existing processor logic
- Microservice architecture established

### ✅ Dry Run Check Passed
- Microservice executed without errors
- No destructive operations performed
- HTTP interface working correctly

## Technical Implementation

### Microservice Architecture
- **Port**: 5050 for runner service
- **Protocol**: HTTP with JSON payloads
- **Endpoint**: POST /run-patch
- **Integration**: Uses existing processor logic

### HTTP Interface
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Request Body**: `{"file": "path/to/patch.json"}`
- **Response**: `{"status": "ok"}`

## Next Steps
- Microservice split ready for P3.02 (Service Discovery)
- Foundation established for microservices architecture
- HTTP interface available for external triggers

## Commit Message
```
[P3.01] microservices-split — Patch runner isolated in service container
```
