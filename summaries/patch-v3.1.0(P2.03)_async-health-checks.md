# Patch v3.1.0(P2.03) - Async Health Checks

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Converted health checks to async probes for runner, tunnel, and daemon components to enable fully async ping probe for system health diagnostics.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/health-aggregator.js` - Async health aggregator with parallel probes
- `summaries/_heartbeat/.async-health.json` - Consolidated health status file

### Key Features
- **Parallel probes**: Uses `Promise.all()` for concurrent health checks
- **Async file operations**: Reads health files asynchronously
- **Fault tolerance**: Individual probe failures don't break aggregation
- **Consolidated output**: Merges all health data into single JSON file

## Technical Implementation
- Reads health files from multiple subsystems concurrently
- Uses `fs.promises.readFile()` for non-blocking I/O
- Implements error handling for missing or corrupted health files
- Merges health data using `Object.assign()` for clean aggregation

## Validation Results
- ✅ Async health aggregator runs successfully
- ✅ Parallel probe execution confirmed
- ✅ Consolidated health file generated
- ✅ All subsystem health data merged correctly

## Health Data Structure
```json
{
  "runner": { "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "pid": 12345 },
  "tunnel": { "status": "connected", "timestamp": "...", "url": "..." },
  "daemon": { "status": "running", "timestamp": "...", "memory": "256MB" }
}
```

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Parallel health checks reduce total probe time
- **Reliability**: Individual failures don't affect other probes
- **Consolidation**: Single health file for easy monitoring
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new health sources

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with async logging and Redis integration.
