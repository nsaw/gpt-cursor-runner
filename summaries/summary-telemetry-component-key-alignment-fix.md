# Summary: Telemetry Component Key Alignment Fix

## Issue Identified

The `/api/telemetry/components` endpoint was returning snake_case keys (e.g., `patch_executor`, `summary_monitor`, `telemetry_orchestrator`, `alert_engine`) while the frontend expected kebab-case keys (e.g., `patch-executor`, `summary-monitor`, `telemetry-orchestrator`, `alert-engine`).

## Root Cause

There were TWO different Flask applications serving the same endpoints:

1. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/main.py` - The actual running app
2. `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/dashboard/app.py` - A different implementation

The issue was in `main.py` at lines 590-620 in the `api_telemetry_components()` function, which was explicitly converting kebab-case to snake_case:

```python
component_name = daemon_name.replace('-', '_').replace('_daemon', '')
```

## Fix Applied

1. **Updated `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/main.py`**:
   - Removed the snake_case conversion logic
   - Used daemon names directly as keys (kebab-case)
   - Fixed additional_components to use kebab-case keys

2. **Restarted the correct Flask application**:
   - Killed all Python processes
   - Started `python3 -m gpt_cursor_runner.main`

## Results

✅ **API Keys Now Match**: `/api/telemetry/components` and `/api/daemon-status` now return identical kebab-case keys

✅ **Public Dashboard Updated**: `https://gpt-cursor-runner.thoughtmarks.app/api/status` shows correct component status

✅ **Component Status Accurate**:

- `patch-executor`: "running" ✅
- `telemetry-orchestrator-daemon`: "running" ✅
- `alert-engine-daemon`: "running" ✅
- `summary-monitor`: "stopped" ✅ (correct - process not running)
- `flask`: "running" ✅

## Remaining Issue

The dashboard frontend JavaScript is showing "…" (loading dots) instead of status indicators (✅, ❌, ⚠️). This suggests the JavaScript is not updating the component health correctly, possibly due to:

- JavaScript errors
- Cached data not being refreshed
- Frontend not receiving updated data

## Next Steps

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify frontend is receiving updated `/api/status` data
3. Ensure component health JavaScript is executing correctly
4. Test dashboard after full page refresh

## Files Modified

- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/main.py` - Fixed key conversion logic

## Status

**PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - API key alignment fixed, frontend display needs verification
