# Patch v3.1.0(P2.06) - Patch Caching

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P2 - Infrastructure Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Cached recently executed patch IDs in Redis to prevent reprocessing of duplicate patch executions.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/processor.js` - Added Redis cache check and deduplication logic

### Key Features
- **Duplicate detection**: Checks Redis for existing patch ID before execution
- **Cache storage**: Stores patch ID with 1-hour TTL after successful execution
- **Skip logic**: Returns early if patch was already processed
- **TTL management**: Automatic expiration prevents cache bloat

## Technical Implementation
- Extracts patch ID from file path using `split('/').pop()`
- Uses Redis key pattern `patch:${id}` for storage
- Implements 3600-second (1-hour) TTL for cache entries
- Adds cache check before patch execution

## Validation Results
- ✅ Patch ID cached in Redis after execution
- ✅ Duplicate patch execution skipped
- ✅ Cache key expires after 1 hour
- ✅ No reprocessing of identical patches

## Cache Behavior
```javascript
// First execution
await redis.set('patch:test-patch.js', 1, 'EX', 3600);

// Subsequent executions
if (await redis.get('patch:test-patch.js')) {
  console.log('[CACHE] Skipped duplicate');
  return;
}
```

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Avoids redundant patch processing
- **Efficiency**: Reduces system load from duplicate executions
- **Reliability**: Prevents race conditions from repeated patches
- **Resource management**: Automatic cache cleanup via TTL

## Next Steps
Phase 2 continues with session caching and cache invalidation.
