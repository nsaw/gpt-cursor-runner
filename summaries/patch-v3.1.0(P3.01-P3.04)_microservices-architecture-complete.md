# Phase 3 Complete - Microservices Architecture

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P3 - Microservices Architecture  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully completed all Phase 3 patches to establish microservices architecture for GHOST 2.0, including service isolation, discovery, communication, and load balancing.

## Patches Completed

### P3.01 - Microservices Split ✅
- **Goal**: Split patch runner into isolated microservice shell
- **Achievement**: Express-based HTTP microservice for patch execution
- **Key Features**: HTTP interface, JSON API, async processing

### P3.02 - Service Discovery ✅
- **Goal**: Add local service registry with hostname and port info
- **Achievement**: Service registration and resolution system
- **Key Features**: Registry utility, auto-registration, JSON registry

### P3.03 - Inter-Service Communication ✅
- **Goal**: Enable JSON-based calls between microservices using registry
- **Achievement**: HTTP communication between services
- **Key Features**: Registry-based routing, fetch API, async communication

### P3.04 - Load Balancing ✅
- **Goal**: Add round-robin load balancing for patch runner services
- **Achievement**: Multi-runner distribution with cycling
- **Key Features**: Round-robin selection, counter-based cycling, load distribution

## Technical Architecture

### Microservices Components
- **Runner Service**: Express server on port 5050 for patch execution
- **Relay Service**: HTTP client for inter-service communication
- **Registry System**: JSON-based service discovery and registration
- **Load Balancer**: Round-robin distribution across multiple runners

### Key Files Created
- `services/runner/index.js` - Patch execution microservice
- `services/relay/index.js` - Inter-service communication relay
- `utils/registry.js` - Service registry with round-robin support
- `services/registry/registry.json` - Service registry file

### Communication Flow
1. Services register themselves in registry on startup
2. Relay service discovers runner via registry lookup
3. HTTP calls made between services using JSON payloads
4. Load balancer cycles through multiple runners

## Validation Summary
- ✅ Microservices architecture established
- ✅ Service discovery and registration working
- ✅ Inter-service HTTP communication functional
- ✅ Round-robin load balancing implemented
- ✅ Registry-based service resolution operational

## Benefits Achieved
- **Service Isolation**: Each service runs independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services and runners
- **Load Distribution**: Multiple runners handle load
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and lookup
- **HTTP Communication**: Standard RESTful inter-service calls

## Next Phase
Phase 4 implementation begins with advanced features and optimizations.
