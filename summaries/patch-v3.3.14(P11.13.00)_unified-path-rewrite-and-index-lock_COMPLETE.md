# patch-v3.3.14(P11.13.00)_unified-path-rewrite-and-index-lock - COMPLETE

## Patch Execution Summary
✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** - Unified path rewrite and index lock with all Ghost and Daemon paths normalized to unified .cursor-cache root

## Critical Achievement
- **NORMALIZED PATHS**: All daemon, dispatch, log, and summary paths normalized to unified .cursor-cache root
- **HARDENED ROUTING**: Patch routing, heartbeat logging, and summary locations use hardened paths
- **UNIFIED STRUCTURE**: Legacy behavior scattered across inconsistent project subtrees eliminated
- **SAFETY ENFORCEMENT**: Hardcoded routing paths for MAIN and CYOPS now standardized

## Problem Resolution
- **LEGACY BEHAVIOR**: Legacy behavior scattered summaries and patches across inconsistent project subtrees
- **INCONSISTENT PATHS**: Patch routing, heartbeat logging, and summary locations used inconsistent paths
- **SCATTERED STRUCTURE**: Daemon pickup, summary write, dispatch confirmation, and loop detection used different path structures
- **UNSTABLE STATE**: Patch system lacked unified path structure for reliable operation

## Technical Implementation
- **PATH AUDITS**: Node script directory path audits (scripts/hooks, scripts/cli, scripts/daemon)
- **CONFIG UPDATES**: `.cursor-config.json` and runner configs updated with unified paths
- **DISPATCH WATCHER**: Ghost dispatch watcher routed to `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches/`
- **DAEMON RESTART**: Daemons and monitors restarted and validated for MAIN + CYOPS
- **DOC DAEMON**: Doc daemon summary move confirmed working
- **INDEX INJECTION**: README.md and INDEX.md injected per subtree

## Validation Results
- ✅ Node script directory path audits completed
- ✅ `.cursor-config.json` and runner configs updated
- ✅ Ghost dispatch watcher routed to `.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches/`
- ✅ Daemons and monitors restarted and validated for MAIN + CYOPS
- ✅ Doc daemon summary move confirmed working
- ✅ README.md and INDEX.md injected per subtree

## Files Modified
- **Enhanced**: `scripts/daemons/doc-daemon.js` - Now targets unified .cursor-cache paths
- **Enhanced**: `scripts/diagnostics/ghost-dispatch-loop.js` - Dispatch queue monitored at unified paths
- **Enhanced**: `scripts/cli/ghost-status.js` - Path default moved to unified .heartbeat
- **Updated**: `.cursor-config.json` - Added unified path configuration
- **Created**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/README.md` - CYOPS cursor cache documentation
- **Created**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/INDEX.md` - CYOPS unified patch index

## Configuration Updates
- **patchRoot**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/patches`
- **summaryRoot**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/summaries`
- **logRoot**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/.logs`
- **heartbeatRoot**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/CYOPS/.heartbeat`

## Directory Structure Created
- **Archive Directories**: `.archive/`, `.completed/`, `.failed/` in patches and summaries
- **Log Directories**: `.logs/` with archive subdirectories
- **Heartbeat Directories**: `.heartbeat/` with archive subdirectories
- **Documentation**: README.md and INDEX.md files in each root

## Safety Features Implemented
- **BACKUP COMPATIBILITY**: Ensured backup compatibility for freeze snapshots
- **STALE LOG PURGE**: Purged stale logs to `.archive/` directories
- **PATH VALIDATION**: All paths validated before use
- **ERROR HANDLING**: Graceful error handling for missing directories
- **TIMEOUT PROTECTION**: All operations include timeout protection

## System Impact
- **UNIFIED STRUCTURE**: All patch operations now use consistent path structure
- **RELIABLE ROUTING**: Patch routing now uses hardened, absolute paths
- **STABLE STATE**: Patch system now has stable, predictable state
- **CONSISTENT BEHAVIOR**: All daemons and monitors use unified path structure

## Use Cases Enabled
- **RELIABLE PATCHING**: Patch operations now use consistent, reliable paths
- **STABLE MONITORING**: Monitoring systems use unified path structure
- **CONSISTENT LOGGING**: All logging operations use unified path structure
- **PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR**: System behavior now predictable across all operations

## Error Recovery Capabilities
- **GRACEFUL FAILURES**: Continues operation even if individual operations fail
- **PATH SAFETY**: Validates all file paths before operations
- **DIRECTORY CREATION**: Automatically creates missing directories
- **FALLBACK SUPPORT**: Graceful degradation for missing files

## Prevention Measures Implemented
- **VALIDATION CHECKS**: Multiple validation points for file operations
- **ERROR ISOLATION**: Individual operation failures don't stop the system
- **SAFE OPERATIONS**: All file operations include error handling
- **TIMEOUT PROTECTION**: Prevents hanging operations

## Technical Details
- **ROOT PATH**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/`
- **SUPPORTED ZONES**: MAIN and CYOPS
- **UNIFIED STRUCTURE**: Consistent directory structure across all zones
- **HARDENED PATHS**: All paths use absolute, hardened references

## Test Results
- **PATH AUDITS**: All script paths validated successfully
- **CONFIG UPDATES**: Configuration files updated correctly
- **DIRECTORY CREATION**: All required directories created
- **DOCUMENTATION**: README and INDEX files created successfully
- **VALIDATION PASSED**: All validation checks passed successfully
- **SYNTAX CHECKS**: All Node.js files pass syntax validation
- **GIT COMMIT**: Changes successfully committed and tagged

## Next Steps
1. **MONITORING**: Monitor system behavior with unified paths
2. **OPTIMIZATION**: Optimize path resolution for performance
3. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update documentation to reflect unified structure
4. **TESTING**: Comprehensive testing of all path-dependent operations

## Conclusion
The unified path rewrite and index lock has been successfully implemented, normalizing all Ghost and Daemon paths to use the unified .cursor-cache root. The patch routing, heartbeat logging, and summary locations now use hardened paths, eliminating the legacy behavior that scattered summaries and patches across inconsistent project subtrees. The system now has a stable, predictable state with consistent behavior across all operations. All validation checks passed successfully, and the changes have been committed to git with appropriate tagging.
