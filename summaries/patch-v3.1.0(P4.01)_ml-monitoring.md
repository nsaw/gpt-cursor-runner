# Patch v3.1.0(P4.01) - ML Monitoring

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Phase:** P4 - Advanced Features  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Injected simple ML model for anomaly classification in logs to classify log lines as normal/anomalous using token heuristics.

## Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified
- `scripts/ml/classify-log.js` - ML log classifier with heuristic detection

### Key Features
- **Heuristic classification**: Uses regex patterns to detect anomalies
- **Token-based filtering**: Filters log lines containing suspicious keywords
- **Anomaly isolation**: Separates anomalous logs into dedicated file
- **Pattern matching**: Detects fail, timeout, and error patterns

## Technical Implementation
- Reads audit log file and splits into lines
- Applies regex filter `/fail|timeout|error/i` for case-insensitive matching
- Filters lines containing suspicious keywords
- Writes filtered anomalies to `logs/anomaly.log`

## Classification Logic
```javascript
const lines = fs.readFileSync('logs/audit.log', 'utf-8').split('\n');
const out = lines.filter(l => /fail|timeout|error/i.test(l));
fs.writeFileSync('logs/anomaly.log', out.join('\n'));
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ ML classifier script created and functional
- ✅ Heuristic anomaly detection implemented
- ✅ Anomaly log file generated
- ✅ Pattern-based classification working

## Benefits
- **Automated monitoring**: Automatic detection of suspicious log entries
- **Anomaly isolation**: Separates problematic logs for analysis
- **Heuristic-based**: Simple but effective pattern matching
- **Log analysis**: Provides insights into system issues

## Next Steps
Phase 4 continues with additional advanced features.
