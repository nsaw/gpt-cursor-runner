# patch-v3.2.5(P10.00.02)_main-runner-conflict-audit

## Execution Summary
✅ **CRITICAL SUCCESS**: MAIN project audited and cleared of ghost-runner interference

## Critical Findings
- **ROGUE FILES DETECTED**: 4 ghost-runner files found in tm-mobile-cursor/scripts/
- **IMMEDIATE CLEANUP**: All conflicting files removed to prevent system interference
- **CPU SPIKE RESOLUTION**: Eliminated potential source of performance degradation

## Files Removed from MAIN
- `scripts/ghost-bridge.js` - Ghost bridge script
- `scripts/patch-executor.js` - Patch execution script  
- `scripts/summary-monitor.js` - Summary monitoring script
- `scripts/validate-runtime.sh` - Runtime validation script

## Validation Results
- ✅ No ghost-runner conflict files found on MAIN
- ✅ CPU process audit shows no ghost interference
- ✅ Clean separation between MAIN and ghost-runner systems established

## Impact Assessment
- **System Isolation**: MAIN project now completely clean of ghost-runner artifacts
- **Conflict Prevention**: Eliminated risk of duplicate patch execution
- **Performance**: Removed potential source of CPU spikes and resource contention

## Audit Artifacts Created
- `scripts/audit/main-ghost-conflict-audit.js` - Audit script for future monitoring
- `scripts/audit/main-cpu-processes.log` - CPU process snapshot for analysis

## Git Status
- **Commit**: `[P10.00.02] main-runner-conflict-audit — MAIN verified or purged of ghost-runner interference`
- **Tag**: `patch-v3.2.5(P10.00.02)_main-runner-conflict-audit`
- **Files Changed**: 6 files changed, 80 insertions(+), 356 deletions(-)

## Next Steps
- Monitor CPU usage for improvement
- Verify ghost-runner system stability in isolation
- Proceed with full system functionality validation
- Implement ongoing conflict detection to prevent future interference
