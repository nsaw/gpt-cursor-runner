# Patch Archive System Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-11  
**Feature:** Automatic patch archiving after completion  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  

## 🗄️ Archive System Overview

Successfully implemented an automatic patch archiving system that moves completed patches (both successful and failed) to `patches/.archive/` to prevent reprocessing and maintain a clean patches directory.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Archive Directory Structure
```
patches/
├── .archive/                    # Archived patches with timestamps
│   ├── patch1_archived_20250711_123456.json
│   ├── patch2_archived_20250711_123457.json
│   └── ...
├── active_patch1.json          # Current active patches
├── active_patch2.json
└── ...
```

### Archive Script: `scripts/archive-completed-patches.sh`

#### Features:
- ✅ **Process Detection**: Checks `patch-log.json` to identify processed patches
- ✅ **Success/Failure Detection**: Distinguishes between successful and failed patches
- ✅ **Timestamped Archives**: Adds timestamps to prevent filename conflicts
- ✅ **Summary Generation**: Creates markdown summaries of archive operations
- ✅ **Safe Processing**: Skips unprocessed patches to avoid premature archiving

#### Archive Process:
1. **Scan Patches**: Iterates through all `.json` files in `patches/`
2. **Check Processing**: Verifies patch appears in `patch-log.json`
3. **Check Success**: Determines if patch was successful or failed
4. **Archive**: Moves processed patches to `patches/.archive/` with timestamp
5. **Summarize**: Generates archive summary in `summaries/` directory

### Integration Points

#### Auto-Apply Script Integration
- **File**: `scripts/auto-apply-cursor-patches.sh`
- **Trigger**: Automatically runs after patch application
- **Logging**: Archives are logged to `logs/auto-apply.log`

#### Apply All Patches Integration
- **File**: `apply_all_patches.py`
- **Parameter**: `auto_archive=True` (default)
- **Behavior**: Archives patches after successful application (non-dry-run)

#### Daemon Integration
- **Schedule**: Runs every 60 seconds via launchd
- **Fallback**: Cron job every 2 minutes
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required

## 📊 Archive Statistics

### Archive Criteria
- ✅ **Processed Patches**: All patches that appear in `patch-log.json`
- ✅ **Successful Patches**: Patches with `"success": true` in log
- ✅ **Failed Patches**: Patches with `"success": false` in log
- ⏳ **Unprocessed Patches**: Skipped to prevent premature archiving

### Archive Naming Convention
```
{original_patch_name}_archived_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.json
```

### Archive Summary Files
- **Location**: `summaries/summary-patch-archive-{timestamp}.md`
- **Content**: Archive statistics, file listings, process details
- **Format**: Markdown with timestamps and metadata

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Archive Safety
- ✅ **Process Validation**: Only archives patches that have been processed
- ✅ **Timestamp Protection**: Prevents filename conflicts with timestamps
- ✅ **Backup Preservation**: Maintains original patch data in archive
- ✅ **Log Integration**: Archives are tracked in patch-log.json

### Recovery Features
- ✅ **Archive Access**: Archived patches remain accessible for review
- ✅ **Summary Tracking**: Each archive operation generates a summary
- ✅ **Process Logging**: Archive operations are logged for audit trail
- ✅ **Manual Override**: Script can be run manually if needed

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Automatic Workflow
1. **Patch Arrives**: GHOST delivers patch to `patches/`
2. **Daemon Detects**: Auto-apply script detects new patch
3. **Patch Applied**: Patch is applied with safety checks
4. **Log Updated**: Result logged to `patch-log.json`
5. **Archive Triggered**: Archive script moves patch to `.archive/`
6. **Summary Generated**: Archive summary created in `summaries/`

### Manual Workflow
```bash
# Manual archive of completed patches
./scripts/archive-completed-patches.sh

# Manual application with archiving
python3 apply_all_patches.py --force-root=/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner
```

## 📈 Benefits

### System Cleanliness
- ✅ **Clean Patches Directory**: Only active patches remain in `patches/`
- ✅ **Prevent Reprocessing**: Archived patches won't be reprocessed
- ✅ **Historical Tracking**: Complete patch history maintained in archives

### Performance
- ✅ **Faster Scanning**: Fewer files to scan in patches directory
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: Clear separation between active and completed patches
- ✅ **Efficient Processing**: Daemon only processes new patches

### Maintenance
- ✅ **Easy Cleanup**: Archive directory can be cleaned periodically
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all patch operations
- ✅ **Recovery**: Archived patches can be restored if needed

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Check Archive Status
```bash
# Count current patches
ls patches/*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Count archived patches
ls patches/.archive/*.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# View archive contents
ls -la patches/.archive/
```

### Manual Archive
```bash
# Archive all completed patches
./scripts/archive-completed-patches.sh

# View archive summary
ls summaries/summary-patch-archive-*.md | tail -1 | xargs cat
```

### Automatic Archive
```bash
# Apply patches with automatic archiving
python3 apply_all_patches.py --force-root=/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner

# Daemon will automatically archive after processing
```

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The patch archive system is now fully operational with:
- ✅ Automatic archiving after patch completion
- ✅ Integration with auto-apply daemon
- ✅ Manual archive capabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and summaries
- ✅ Safety features to prevent data loss
- ✅ Clean separation of active and completed patches

**Next**: All future patch completions will be automatically archived to maintain a clean and efficient patch processing system.
