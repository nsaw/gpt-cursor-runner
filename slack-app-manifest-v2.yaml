  description: Full control interface for GPT-powered Cursor automation
  background_color: "#4A154B"
  long_description: >
    Robots using robots to control robots. This Slack app serves as a command interface
    for a GPT-powered hybrid automation pipeline, controlling Cursor through carefully
    structured instructional blocks and real-time patch orchestration. It's a fusion
    of natural language and precision tooling, letting humans guide AI which guides
    other AI.

    Robots using robots to control robots. From phase tagging to thematic overrides,
    this app delivers full-cycle control over Cursor's render, audit, and layout enforcement loop.
    Integration flows are driven via slash commands, Slack events, and webhook triggersâ€”
    all wrapped in a command interface for structured patch logic and rollback safety.

    Robots using robots to control robots. From approving patches to reverting failed phases,
    from restarting GPT workflows to toggling auto modes, this is the control center.
    This is the war room. This is Cursor's boss. And Cursor listens to it.
