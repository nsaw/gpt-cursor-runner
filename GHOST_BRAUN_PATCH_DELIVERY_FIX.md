# Ghost-BRAUN Patch Delivery Fix

## Problem Diagnosis

**Issue**: Despite Ghost runner confirming patch delivery, patches were not landing in the expected directory at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches/`.

**Root Cause**: Configuration mismatch between Ghost runner and BRAUN (AGENT 1):

- **Ghost runner** was correctly writing patches to: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches/`
- **BRAUN (AGENT 1)** was looking for patches in: `patches/` (relative to current working directory)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Webhook Handler (`gpt_cursor_runner/webhook_handler.py`)

- Added `get_patches_directory()` function to make patches directory configurable
- Added support for `PATCHES_DIRECTORY` environment variable
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to relative `patches/` directory

### 2. Updated Patch Viewer (`gpt_cursor_runner/patch_viewer.py`)

- Modified `list_patches()` to use configurable patches directory
- Added support for environment variable configuration
- Fixed type annotations for better code quality

### 3. Updated Read Patches (`gpt_cursor_runner/read_patches.py`)

- Modified `read_patches()` to use `PATCHES_DIRECTORY` environment variable
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. Created Configuration File (`.patchrc`)

- Added `patches_directory` configuration option
- Set default to correct tm-mobile-cursor location
- Provides centralized configuration management

### 5. Created Test Scripts

- `test_patch_reading.py` - Verifies patch reading from correct directory
- `braun_patch_processor.py` - Demonstrates BRAUN patch processing workflow

## Verification

### Ghost Runner Status
- ‚úÖ Running on port 5051
- ‚úÖ Successfully receiving and processing patches
- ‚úÖ Writing patches to correct location: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches/`

### BRAUN (AGENT 1) Status
- ‚úÖ Now configured to read from correct patches directory
- ‚úÖ Successfully finding patches (found 3 test patches)
- ‚úÖ Patch processing workflow working correctly

### Test Results
```bash
$ python3 test_patch_reading.py
üîç Testing patch reading...
üìÅ Using patches directory: /Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches
üì¶ Found 3 patches using read_patches()
üì¶ Found 3 patches using list_patches()
‚úÖ Patch reading test passed!

$ python3 braun_patch_processor.py
ü§ñ BRAUN (AGENT 1) Patch Processor
üì¶ Found 3 patches to process
‚úÖ BRAUN patch processing complete!
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export PATCHES_DIRECTORY="/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches"
export SUMMARIES_DIRECTORY="/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries"
```

### Configuration File (`.patchrc`)
```json
{
  "patches": {
    "patches_directory": "/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches"
  }
}
```

## Workflow

1. **GPT** ‚Üí Sends patches to Ghost runner via webhook
2. **Ghost Runner** ‚Üí Receives patches and writes to configured directory
3. **BRAUN (AGENT 1)** ‚Üí Reads patches from same configured directory
4. **BRAUN** ‚Üí Applies patches to target files in tm-mobile-cursor project

## Files Modified

- `gpt_cursor_runner/webhook_handler.py` - Made patches directory configurable
- `gpt_cursor_runner/patch_viewer.py` - Updated to use configurable directory
- `gpt_cursor_runner/read_patches.py` - Updated to use environment variable
- `.patchrc` - Added configuration file
- `test_patch_reading.py` - Created test script
- `braun_patch_processor.py` - Created BRAUN processor demo

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

The Ghost-BRAUN patch delivery issue has been diagnosed and fixed. Both Ghost runner and BRAUN are now configured to use the same patches directory, ensuring patches are properly delivered and processed.
