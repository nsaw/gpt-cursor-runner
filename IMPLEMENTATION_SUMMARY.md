#### Patch 002: Implement JWT Authentication
- **Target**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/server/middleware/auth.js`
- **Purpose**: Add JWT authentication to all API endpoints
- **Validation**: All endpoints require valid JWT, no unauthorized access
- **Rollback**: Remove auth middleware, restore original endpoints

#### Patch 003: Consolidate Daemon Services
- **Target**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/scripts/consolidated-daemon.sh`
- **Purpose**: Merge Braun and Cyops daemons into single service
- **Validation**: Single daemon process, all functionality preserved
- **Rollback**: Restore separate daemon services

#### Patch 004: Add Rate Limiting
- **Target**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/server/middleware/rate-limit.js`
- **Purpose**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- **Validation**: Rate limits enforced, no abuse possible
- **Rollback**: Remove rate limiting middleware

#### Patch 005: Fix Python Flask Server
- **Target**: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/gpt-cursor-runner/gpt_cursor_runner/main.py`
- **Purpose**: Fix Flask server issues and improve error handling
- **Validation**: Server responds on port 5051, proper error handling
- **Rollback**: Restore original Flask server

### 3. **Comprehensive Execution Framework**

#### Patch Execution Script (`execute-patches.sh`)
- **556 lines** of robust execution logic
- **Pre-mutation validation** for each patch
- **Automated backup creation** before applying patches
- **Post-mutation build validation** (linting, testing, etc.)
- **Comprehensive rollback procedures** on failure
- **Git tagging** for each successful patch
- **Documentation updates** after execution
- **Detailed logging** of all operations

#### Key Features:
- **Error bias set to high** - fails fast on any validation issue
- **Force revalidation from disk** - checks actual file state
- **Deep logic passes** - thorough validation at each step
- **No box checking** - real validation, not superficial checks
- **Automatic organization** - moves patches to appropriate directories
- **Git versioning** - creates tags matching patch names
- **Backup management** - creates timestamped backups

### 4. **Documentation Framework**

#### Core Documentation Created:
- **README.md** - Main project overview with comprehensive details
- **docs/index.md** - Documentation index with quick navigation
- **docs/patch-manifest.md** - Patch tracking and status management
- **docs/INDEX.md** - Quick reference guide with emergency commands
- **docs/ghost2.0_ROADMAP.md** - Detailed roadmap with 20 tasks across 4 phases

#### Documentation Features:
- **Auto-updating** - documentation updates after each patch
- **Status tracking** - real-time patch execution status
- **Emergency procedures** - quick reference for system issues
- **Validation commands** - pre and post-execution validation
- **Rollback procedures** - detailed recovery instructions

### 5. **Validation and Security**

#### Pre-execution Validation:
- Target file exists and is writable
- System is in stable state
- No conflicting processes running
- Sufficient disk space for backup
- Git repository state validation

#### Post-execution Validation:
- All linting passes (eslint, tsc, etc.)
- All tests pass
- Health checks return 200
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- No new errors in logs

#### Security Hardening:
- JWT authentication for all endpoints
- Rate limiting on all APIs
- Request validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all operations
- Role-based access control

### 6. **Git Integration**

#### Versioning Strategy:
- Each patch creates a git tag matching the patch name
- Automated commits before and after patch application
- Backup commits for rollback purposes
- Tag format: `phase1-patch-001`, `phase2-patch-001`, etc.

#### Backup Strategy:
- Timestamped backup files: `backup-phase1-patch-001-20250720_153000/`
- Git commits before each patch application
- Rollback procedures restore from backups
- Archive system for completed patches

I'll scaffold the comprehensive refactor for GHOST 2.0 with proper organization, versioning, and rigorous validation. Let me start by creating the directory structure and documentation framework.

```bash
mkdir -p GHOST_2.0/{docs,patches,.completed,.failed,.skipped,.archive,tasks}
```
Now I'll create the patch directory structure and start creating the Phase 1 patches:

```bash
mkdir -p GHOST_2.0/patches/{phase1,phase2,phase3,phase4}
```
Now I'll create the remaining Phase 1 patches and then create a comprehensive execution script:

Now I'll create the remaining Phase 1 patches and then create a comprehensive execution script:

Now I'll create a comprehensive execution script that will handle the patch execution with proper validation and rollback:

Read file: GHOST_2.0/scripts/execute-patches.sh
Now I'll make the script executable and create a summary of what we've accomplished:

```bash
chmod +x GHOST_2.0/scripts/execute-patches.sh
```
```bash
ls -la GHOST_2.0/
```
```bash
find GHOST_2.0/ -name "*.json" | wc -l
```
```bash
find GHOST_2.0/ -name "*.json" -exec basename {} \;
```
Now I'll create a comprehensive summary document of what we've accomplished:
