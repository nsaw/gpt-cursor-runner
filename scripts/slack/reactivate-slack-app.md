# Reactivating the Deactivated Slack App

## Status: ‚ùå APP DEACTIVATED - NEEDS REACTIVATION

**Date**: 2025-07-31 06:30 UTC  
**Issue**: Slack app `gpt-cursor-webhook-thoughtmarks` has been deactivated  
**Solution**: Manual reactivation required in Slack app settings  

## üö® **Immediate Action Required**

The Slack app has been deactivated, which is why:
- OAuth installation fails
- App tokens don't work properly
- "Install to Workspace" button is not available

## üîß **Reactivation Steps**

### **Step 1: Access Slack App Settings**
1. Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps/A09469H0C2K
2. You should see a message indicating the app is deactivated

### **Step 2: Reactivate the App**
1. **Look for "Reactivate App" button** - it should be prominently displayed
2. **Click "Reactivate App"** to restore the app to active status
3. **Confirm the reactivation** if prompted

### **Step 3: Verify App Status**
1. **Check the app status** - should show "Active" instead of "Deactivated"
2. **Verify OAuth & Permissions** - all scopes should still be configured
3. **Check Redirect URLs** - should include the callback URL

### **Step 4: Test Installation**
1. **Look for "Install App" button** in OAuth & Permissions section
2. **If available, click "Install App"** to install to workspace
3. **If not available, use the OAuth URL** we generated

## üìã **Expected Results After Reactivation**

Once the app is reactivated:
- ‚úÖ App status will show "Active"
- ‚úÖ "Install App" button should appear
- ‚úÖ OAuth installation should work
- ‚úÖ All configured scopes will be available
- ‚úÖ Bot token generation will work

## üîç **Why This Happened**

Slack apps can be deactivated for several reasons:
- **Inactivity** - App not used for extended period
- **Policy violation** - App behavior that violates Slack policies
- **Manual deactivation** - Someone manually deactivated the app
- **Configuration issues** - App configuration problems

## üéØ **Next Steps After Reactivation**

1. **Reactivate the app** using the steps above
2. **Try the OAuth installation** again with the URL we generated
3. **Test the webhook-thoughtmarks functionality**
4. **Verify all 25 slash commands work**

## üìû **If Reactivation Fails**

If you can't reactivate the app:
1. **Check for error messages** in the Slack app settings
2. **Contact Slack support** if there are policy violations
3. **Create a new app** as a last resort (we can migrate the configuration)
