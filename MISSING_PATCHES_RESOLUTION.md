# Missing Patches Resolution

## Problem Summary

The user reported that specific patches were missing from the expected location:
- `patch-1.4.1e-1-1e_src-crawl-snapshot.json`
- `patch-1.4.1e-1-2e_structure-checks.json`
- `patch-1.4.1e-1-3e_src-nextgen-init.json`
- `patch-1.4.1e-1-4e_theme-role-token-audit.json`
- `patch-1.4.1e-1-5e_blueprint-scan.json`

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Ghost Runner Issues**: The Ghost runner was not running properly due to Python environment issues
2. **Patch Location**: The missing patches were found in a subdirectory `patches_1.4.1e_bundle/` instead of the main patches directory
3. **Patch Format**: The patches were placeholder files with incorrect JSON structure

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Fixed Ghost Runner Environment
- Identified Python environment issues (system Python vs virtual environment)
- Started Ghost runner with correct virtual environment
- Verified Ghost runner is listening on port 5051

### 2. Located Missing Patches
- Found patches in `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/tasks/patches/patches_1.4.1e_bundle/`
- Moved patches to main patches directory for BRAUN to access

### 3. Fixed Patch Format
- Converted placeholder patches to proper patch format with:
  - `id`: Unique patch identifier
  - `role`: Patch type (ui_patch)
  - `target_file`: Target file path
  - `patch`: Pattern and replacement
  - `description`: Human-readable description
  - `metadata`: Author, source, timestamp

### 4. Verified BRAUN Integration
- Updated BRAUN configuration to read from correct patches directory
- Tested patch reading functionality
- Confirmed BRAUN can process all 8 patches (including the 5 missing ones)

## Current Status

### ✅ Resolved Issues
- **Ghost Runner**: Running correctly on port 5051
- **Patch Location**: All patches now in correct directory
- **Patch Format**: All patches have proper JSON structure
- **BRAUN Integration**: Can read and process all patches
